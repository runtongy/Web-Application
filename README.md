#A repository for my Web Application project.
#
#	Created a web application to provide customers with fairer review of restaurants.
#   o	Used API to grab data from Yelp app and Zoomato app.
#   o	Collected the data and saved them in mongo DB.
#   o	Used Angular JS and JavaScript to construct the outlook of my web application and to write the algorithm that is used to calculate the fairer review based on the data I got.
